BAE Systems is the third largest defense contractor in the world with an exceptional, mission-focused culture. The 800+ BAE Systems employees and sub-contractors located at Hill Air Force Base, Utah are closely aligned to the United States Air Force Nuclear Weapons Center. We support the Center in sustaining the existing LGM-30 Minuteman III (MM III) weapon system and acquiring its replacement, Sentinel program formerly known as Ground-Based Strategic Deterrent. We are a uniquely-valued mission partner delivering daily technical excellence and innovative solutions to our government customers. BAE Systems has earned accolades as a “Top Workplace” in Utah based on employee feedback for three consecutive years, earning special distinction for providing a healthy work-life balance for our valued employees. We work very hard to ensure this is a great place to work! * Why Utah? You’ve got to see it to believe it! Utah is an amazing state with diverse geography, an eclectic culture and an exceptional quality of life. We are located north of Salt Lake City at the foot of the beautiful Wasatch Mountains. The area offers an incredible range of outdoors pursuits across the seasons including hiking, climbing, hunting, fishing, camping, boating and world-class skiing at resorts that hosted the 2002 Winter Olympics. The state is home to five amazing National Parks and an easy drive from two more; Grand Teton and, famously, the first National Park in the world, Yellowstone. The Salt Lake City area offers a vast array of cultural activities and businesses including multiple professional sports teams. It is a western states hub for exceptional, cutting-edge medical care with people traveling from across the region for a range of nationally renowned specialty care centers and doctors. The Salt Lake International Airport is expanding and offers easy, direct access to just about anywhere you want to fly.*  Why Sentinel? The Sentinel Program is an enormous and complex “Mega-Project” modernizing the entire ICBM weapon system deployed across tens of thousands of square miles in five states. Without any doubt, Sentinel is one of the DoD’s most important acquisition efforts for the next decade, if not longer. It includes a complete refurbishment of hundreds of aging Minuteman III ICBM facilities to secure and support a newly designed, technologically advanced ballistic missile. It will also provide an entirely new command and control system as well as vast array of required support equipment specifically engineered to operate and sustain the new weapon system over the decades ahead. Sentinel is the Department of Defense’s newest official “program of record,” having just achieved Milestone B. It enjoys broad, strong support at the national level. It is a long-term project - the weapon system will deploy over a nine-year period beginning in approximately 2026, and remain operational until at least 2075. Sentinel is a career-defining program that will present unique and challenging opportunities that simply are not available with smaller projects.

Their metrics are all based around revenue and income. We are a military acquisition, so all of our success metrics are based around expenditure and schedule. The data warehouse we are building collects all of the data about the acquisition: how much have we spent on what parts of Sentinel. Eventually we would like to collect metadata about actual engineering products to compare against our financial data, to actually gauge whether money spent equals progress made. This is something no other DoD program has ever attempted, and involves creating new and interesting data structures to collect and process the information.
